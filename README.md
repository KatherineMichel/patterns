#### Terminology

General
* [Gossip Dissemination](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/gossip-dissemination.html): Use a random selection of nodes to pass on information to ensure it reaches all the nodes in the cluster without flooding the network
* [HeartBeat](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/heartbeat.html): Show a server is available by periodically sending a message to all the other servers.
* [Lease](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/lease.html): Use time-bound leases for cluster nodes to coordinate their activities.

Clock
* [Clock-Bound Wait](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/clock-bound-wait.html): Wait to cover the uncertainty in time across cluster nodes before reading and writing values so that values can be correctly ordered across cluster nodes
* [Generation Clock](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/generation-clock.html): A monotonically increasing number indicating the generation of the server
* [Hybrid Clock](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/hybrid-clock.html): Use a combination of system timestamp and logical timestamp to have versions as date and time, which can be ordered
* [Lamport Clock](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/lamport-clock.html): Use logical timestamps as a version for a value to allow ordering of values across servers

Consistency, Election, Quorum, Consensus Algorithm
* [Consistent Core](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/consistent-core.html): Maintain a smaller cluster providing stronger consistency to allow the large data cluster to coordinate server activities without implementing quorum-based algorithms
* [Emergent Leader](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/emergent-leader.html): Order cluster nodes based on their age within the cluster to allow nodes to select a leader without running an explicit election
* [Leader and Followers](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/leader-follower.html): Have a single server to coordinate replication across a set of servers
* [Majority Quorum](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/majority-quorum.html): Avoid two groups of servers making independent decisions by requiring majority for taking every decision
* [Paxos](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/paxos.html): Use two consensus building phases to reach safe consensus even when nodes disconnect

Read Requests
* [Follower Reads](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/follower-reads.html): Serve read requests from followers to achieve better throughput and lower latency

Requests
* [Idempotent Receiver](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/idempotent-receiver.html): Identify requests from clients uniquely so you can ignore duplicate requests when client retries
* [Request Batch](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-batch.html): Combine multiple requests to optimally utilise the network
* [Request Pipeline](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-pipeline.html): Improve latency by sending multiple requests on the connection without waiting for the response of the previous requests: 
* [Request Waiting List](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-waiting-list.html): Track client requests which require responses after the criteria to respond is met based on responses from other cluster nodes
* [Single-Socket Channel](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/single-socket-channel.html): Maintain the order of the requests sent to a server by using a single TCP connection
* [Singular Update Queue](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/singular-update-queue.html): Use a single thread to process requests asynchronously to maintain order without blocking the caller

Updates
* [State Watch ](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/state-watch.html): Notify clients when specific values change on the server
* [Two-Phase Commit](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/two-phase-commit.html): Update resources on multiple nodes in one atomic operation
* [Version Vector ](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/version-vector.html): Maintain a list of counters, one per cluster node, to detect concurrent updates
* [Versioned Value](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/versioned-value.html): Store every update to a value with a new version, to allow reading historical values

Partitions
* [Fixed Partitions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/fixed-partitions.html): Keep the number of partitions fixed to keep the mapping of data to partition unchanged when the size of a cluster changes
* [Key-Range Partitions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/key-range-partitions.html): Partition data in sorted key ranges to efficiently handle range queries

Logs
* [Segmented Log](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/segmented-log.html): Split log into multiple smaller files instead of a single large file for easier operations
* [Write-Ahead Log](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/write-ahead-log.html): Provide durability guarantee without the storage data structures to be flushed to disk, by persisting every state change as a command to the append only log
* [Replicated Log](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/replicated-log.html): Keep the state of multiple nodes synchronized by using a write-ahead log that is replicated to all the cluster nodes
* [High-Water Mark](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/high-watermark.html): An index in the write-ahead log showing the last successful replication
* [Low-Water Mark](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/low-watermark.html): An index in the write-ahead log showing which portion of the log can be discarded
